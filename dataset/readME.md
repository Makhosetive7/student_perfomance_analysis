# Student Performance Analysis Insights

## Project Overview

Understanding student performance requires analyzing multiple factors beyond just academic metrics. This project examines how extracurricular activities, tutoring, parental support, and demographic factors influence GPA outcomes. The analysis helps educators, parents, and policymakers identify effective support strategies and optimize resource allocation to improve student success across diverse populations.

Project is done through comprehensive SQL and Python analysis of 5,000 student records across 4 grade levels, revealing patterns in academic performance and support system effectiveness.

## Insights

- Extracurricular activities show minimal direct impact on GPA, suggesting they provide holistic development benefits beyond academic performance.
- Tutoring provides significant academic benefits with a 0.11 GPA improvement and reduces absenteeism, making it one of the most effective interventions.
- Parental support shows a strong, consistent correlation with academic performance, with each support level providing incremental GPA benefits.
- Combined support systems (tutoring + parental support + activities) create synergistic effects, producing the best academic outcomes.
- Moderate extracurricular involvement (1-2 activities) maintains GPA, while overcommitment (3+ activities) shows slight academic decline.
- Tutoring provides the greatest benefit for students with low study time, offering a 0.23 GPA improvement for this at-risk group.
- While support access varies across demographics, the effectiveness of support systems remains consistent across all groups when implemented.
- Students lacking both extracurricular engagement and parental support represent the highest-risk group requiring targeted interventions.
